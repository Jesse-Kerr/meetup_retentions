*BACKGROUND*

* There are nearly 350,000 Meetup groups globally. Around 82% of their information is public.

* Each Meetup group has had some number of events in the past, and each of those has been attended by some individuals. 

* Different meetups are more or less popular.


*HYPOTHESIS*

Categories that are less popular will have higher retention rates. (Correlation)


*NULL HYPOTHESIS*

There will be no difference in retention rates per category.


*METHODS*

1. Calculate retention rate from one event to the next, take average from each group.

2. Take average of each category.

3. Measure popularity of each category by either a) Number of meetup groups in category or b) Average number of attendees / event for category.

4. Do a Z-test or t-test to compare retention rates per category.

5. See if popularity of category (measured in 3) correlates with retention rate.
